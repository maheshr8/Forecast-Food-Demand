# Forecast-Food-Demand
ABSTRACT: 
This project report presents a Hadoop data pipeline and predictive model for food demand forecasting for a meal delivery company. Accurately predicting food demand is crucial for operational efficiency and cost control in the industry. The dataset used in this project was collected over a period of 145 weeks and the objective is to create a Hadoop data pipeline and predict the orders of the upcoming weeks. The project aims to create a flexible and robust framework for processing and analyzing data at scale and to build a predictive model for food demand forecasting by type of food and day of the week. The methodology includes data gathering and preparation, database creation, Hadoop and Sqoop, Spark and Machine Learning, and model evaluation. The success metrics include prediction accuracy and regression model comparison. The predictive model is evaluated using metric such as Root Mean Squared Error. The performance of different models will be compared to determine the best-performing model. This project is expected to provide valuable insights into the food industryâ€™s operational efficiency and cost control. The use of a Hadoop data pipeline will enable handling and analyzing huge volumes of data from RDBMS systems while benefiting from the scalability and affordability of Hadoop. The project will contribute to the development of a predictive model that can be used to plan the stock of raw materials for a meal delivery company, leading to operational efficiency and cost control.
